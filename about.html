    <h1>/ABOUT</h1>
    <p>
      This font, <b>SYMBIOSIS v1.0</b>, was developed to explore our (humanity's) 
      relationship with technology. It features 6 different styles of various levels 
      of distortion: starting with a vectorization of my handwiting, and ending with 
      some loose semblance of a letterform. I used p5js and perlin noise (see the hero above) to distort and 
      pixelate the forms of my handwriting. Once the distorted letterforms were screenshotted, 
      I took them into illustrator and Image Traced them, creating some pretty wonky pixel grids 
      that I honestly liked more than I thought I would. 
    </p>
    
    <h1>/DIST</h1>
    <p>
      Utilizing perlin noise as a method of distortion, I displaced the 
      letterforms, and used a pixel grid to keep the resolution of the letterforms crisp 
      for vectorization. Perlin noise is a common method of distortion used for generating
      noise, and also landforms (the terrain generated in Minecraft uses perlin noise!)
      It is also featured in the hero section above, where you can hover over it to interact.
